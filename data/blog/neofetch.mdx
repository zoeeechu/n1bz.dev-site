Recently, I was setting up a new Arch installation and **REALLY** wanted to put [n1bz](https://www.n1bz.dev/blog/welcome) as a 
custom Neofetch logo just imagine how cool that would be!

After researching, I was getting bits and pieces of answers, but not the complete 
answer I was looking for. It was weird that I couldn’t find anything on it, but I figured how hard could it be? 
And spoiler alert, it actually wasn’t hard at all!

So in case you end up with the same issue, here ya go here’s how to do it, you’re welcome.

So, grab your custom logo and a cup of coffee, and let's dive right in! 
> Quick note: Any logo format like PNG, JPEG, etc. will work, but I'd suggest PNG for extra flair.

For this mini project, we need to edit the *config.conf* file, which should be located here: 
`~/.config/neofetch/config.conf`

But before we start, let's install [*jp2a*](https://github.com/cslarsen/jp2a) we'll need it for this project. 
> Note: *jp2a* is a tool that transforms images into ASCII art.

To install [*jp2a*](https://github.com/cslarsen/jp2a), execute this command:
```bash
> sudo pacman -S jp2a
```

Now, you'll need to find two lines `# Image backend` and `# Image Source` usually found at the top of 
the `# Backend Settings` section.

First, we'll switch out `image_backend="ascii"` with `image_backend="jp2a"`. Feel free to <Censor>fuck</Censor> around and 
experiment with other options!

Next, let's replace `image_source="auto"` with `image_source="/path/to/your/logo.png"`.

After that, we hit save and see the magic, hehehe.

```bash
> neofetch
```

There we go! We now have our very own personalized Neofetch!
