*[alt title]: **Personalizing Neofetch: Adding Your Signature Logo for a Unique Touch***

--- 

Recently, I was setting up a new Arch installation recently and **REALLY** wanted to put [n1bz](https://www.n1bz.dev/blog/welcome) as a
custom Neofetch logo â€“ just imagine how cool that would be!

Upon researching, I was getting bits and pieces of answers, but not the complete
answer I was seeking. It seemed like this was something that hadn't been fully addressed. This was puzzling, especially because the community seemed to deem it as a straightforward task â€“ and spoiler alert, it actually was!

Nevertheless, I decided to share my findings for those who might encounter the same issue.
Consider this your guide if you stumble upon this problem too!

So, grab your custom logo and a cup of coffee, and let's dive right in!
> Quick note: Any logo format like PNG, JPEG, etc. would work, but I'd suggest PNG for extra flair.

For this mini project, we need to edit the *'config.conf'* file, which should be located here:
`~/.config/neofetch/config.conf`

But before we jump in, let's start by installing [*jp2a*](https://security.archlinux.org/package/jp2a) â€“ we'll need it for this project.
> Note: 'jp2a' is a tool that transforms images into ASCII art.

To install [*jp2a,*](https://security.archlinux.org/package/jp2a) execute this command:
```
sudo pacman -S jp2a
```

Now, you'll need to locate two lines â€“ `# Image backend` and `# Image Source`  usually found at the top of
`# Backend Settings` section.

First, we'll switch out `image_backend="ascii"` with `image_backend="jp2a"`; naturally, feel free to
experiment with other options and play around!

Next, let's replace `image_source="auto"` with `image_source="/path/to/your/logo.png"`.

With these changes made, don't forget to save the file. You're almost good to go!
To see the magic in action, put it to the test by entering the command:
```
neofetch
```

And there you have it!, with a bit of experimentation you've woven your Neofetch to be uniquely yours! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¨
