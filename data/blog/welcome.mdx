## 👀 _Well... well... well... what do we have here?_ 

You might be wondering what this site is about! 
This site will serve two purposes: a place where I can document my work, discoveries, and experiments while also showcasing my work 
and building my portfolio so you can not only learn something but also learn about my mistakes and projects.

It also serves as a way to get in contact with me if you are interested in my work, have questions, 
or are looking to hire me.

I look forward to seeing you come on this adventure with me!

## 👀 _IS THAT A CAT LOGO?_

Yup, yes it is! This logo actually started off as a concept for an AI virtual assistant called _"nibz"_. 
I came up with this concept in my early high school years it’s based on an AI program called _"Mogwai"_ 
that serves a character called [_Asagi Aiba_](https://myanimelist.net/character/89415/Asagi_Aiba), which she uses to 
"break into any firewalls, hack into any secured sites, or create and alter any programs."

Nowadays, however, _"N1BZ"_ serves more as an alias than anything. I do hope to one day fulfill my dream 
of making N1BZ an incredible ethical hacking/multipurpose AI that could be groundbreaking for cybersecurity. 
Until then, it serves as a nice alias and a sweet logo that resembles a cyber cat.
