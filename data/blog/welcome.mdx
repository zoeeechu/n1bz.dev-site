hello

## 👀 _Whats going on here?_  

You might be wondering what this site is about!
Put simply, this site serves two purposes: a place
where I can document my discoveries in blog format as well as
Showcase my portfolio! so you can hopefully learn more about me and learn from my
mistakes and my projects, while also having the opportunity to explore my portfolio.
and find ways to get in contact with me if you are interested in my work or have questions.
or are looking to hire me.

I look forward to seeing you more on our journey through the tech space together!


## 🤔 _Whats with the logo?_

Is that a cat- ? 
Why yes, it is! This logo actually started off as a concept for an AI virtual assistant called _"nibz"_ 
I had envisioned in my early high school years, it is based on an AI program called _"Mogwai"_
that serves a character called [_Asagi Aiba_](https://myanimelist.net/character/89415/Asagi_Aiba) that she uses to help her "break
into any firewalls, to hack into any secured sites, or to create and alter any programs." [^1]

Nowadays, however, _"N1BZ"_ serves more as an alias than anything I do hope to one day fulfill my dream.
of making N1BZ an incredable ethical hacking/multipurpose AI which would be ground-breaking cyber security wise,
However, until then, it serves as a nice alias and a sweet logo that resembles a cyber cat.
