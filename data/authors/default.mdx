Hey there! Zoe here, I make Game Engines! Currently, I am a student at Humber College studying [Game Programming](https://mediaarts.humber.ca/programs/game-programming.html). Besides that, I love getting hands-on, messy, and tinkering with whatever new device comes my way. I am the maker of [StarStruck](https://github.com/StarStruckEngine/StarStruck), a game engine that's basically Love2D _but_ 3D... if you squint hard enough. Other than that, I run on chai and coffee. You will probably catch me humming my favorite song, [Petals on the Moon](https://open.spotify.com/track/3BmaFHt6q91CmMrA7fLLRC).
