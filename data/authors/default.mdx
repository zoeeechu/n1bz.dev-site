Hello there! I'm Zoe, currently a student at Humber College. I'm all about tinkering and getting hands-on with whatever comes my way. Whether it's making things work just the way I want or diving into software, hardware, and graphic design, I'm your go-to person.

You could call me a tech enthusiast! Right now, I'm focused on studying  [Game Programming](https://mediaarts.humber.ca/programs/game-programming.html) and even dabbling in reverse engineering. My skillset covers a wide range, from programming and hardware know-how to handling Linux servers and crafting cool graphics. Let's explore the tech world together!
